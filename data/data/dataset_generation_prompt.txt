Act as a Senior Retail Data Scientist.

Generate a realistic 12-month retail KPI dataset (Jan 2024 – Dec 2024) 
for a single multi-category retail store.

The dataset must follow strict retail business logic and mathematical consistency.

Columns required:

1. Month
2. Traffic (store visitors)
3. Transactions
4. Conversion_Rate
5. Avg_Basket_Value
6. Sales_Revenue
7. Total_Customers
8. Returning_Customers
9. Retention_Rate
10. Electronics_Sales
11. Clothing_Sales
12. Grocery_Sales
13. Category_Total_Check

Business Logic Rules:

1. Transactions must be <= Traffic.
2. Conversion_Rate = Transactions / Traffic.
3. Sales_Revenue = Transactions × Avg_Basket_Value.
4. Retention_Rate = Returning_Customers / Total_Customers.
5. Electronics_Sales + Clothing_Sales + Grocery_Sales = Sales_Revenue.
6. Seasonal impact:
   - Higher traffic in November and December.
   - Slight dip in February.
7. Gradual improvement in retention rate over time.
8. Electronics category should show stronger growth trend than Grocery.
9. No unrealistic sudden jumps (max 15% MoM change unless seasonal).
10. Data must look like real retail performance, not random numbers.

Include a scenario where:
- Traffic drops in one month
- Conversion improves
- Sales remain stable due to basket increase

Make data realistic and explain the business reasoning briefly after the table.

Output as clean tabular format suitable for Excel export.
