# Retail KPI Advanced Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Retail KPI diagnostic analysis using 6 months of performance data.  
The objective is to break down revenue movement into its core drivers and generate actionable business insights.

The analysis focuses on understanding:

- Traffic performance
- Conversion rate behavior
- Average basket value trends
- Customer retention
- Product category contribution
- Revenue scenario simulation

This project demonstrates business-oriented retail analytics, not just data calculations.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key variables:

- Month
- Traffic (store visitors)
- Transactions
- Average Basket Value
- Sales Revenue
- Returning Customers
- Category-level Sales (Electronics, Clothing, Grocery)

## 📐 Core KPI Formulas

**1️⃣ Conversion Rate**
Conversion Rate = Transactions / Traffic

**2️⃣ Sales Revenue**
Sales = Transactions × Average Basket Value

**3️⃣ Retention Rate**
Retention Rate = Returning Customers / Total Customers

**4️⃣ Category Contribution**
Category Contribution % = Category Sales / Total Sales

**5️⃣ Month-over-Month Growth**
Growth % = (Current Month Sales - Previous Month Sales) / Previous Month Sales

## 🔍 Performance Analysis Summary

### Revenue Trend
Sales experienced volatility in early months due to declining conversion rate, followed by recovery driven by traffic growth and improved transaction volume.

### Conversion Behavior
Conversion instability was identified as the primary driver of revenue fluctuations.

### Retention Analysis
Retention rate improved steadily across the period, indicating stronger customer loyalty and improving long-term business sustainability.

### Category Contribution
- Electronics emerged as the dominant revenue driver.
- Grocery contribution gradually declined.
- Increasing dependency on a single category introduces strategic risk.

## 📈 Scenario Simulation – Conversion Improvement

A revenue simulation was performed to evaluate the financial impact of a 2% increase in conversion rate.

Result:
A +2% conversion increase generates significant additional monthly revenue without increasing marketing spend.

Business Insight:
Improving operational efficiency and in-store experience may deliver higher ROI compared to investing solely in traffic acquisition.
